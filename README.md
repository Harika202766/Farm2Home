# Farm2Home
The agricultural sector faces significant challenges in ensuring fair market access for farmers, often leading to reduced profits due to middlemen, inefficient logistics, and price volatility. Existing platforms struggle with issues such as high commission fees, lack of proper storage, and limited digital adoption among farmers. This project aims to develop a hub-based supply chain system that collects produce from farmers at multiple locations, ensures proper storage and quality checks, and directly distributes it to consumers and vendors. By eliminating unnecessary intermediaries, the platform will  enhance price transparency, and provide farmers with a stable and profitable market. Leveraging technology for real-time demand insights, digital payments, and efficient order management, this system will create a sustainable, scalable, and farmer-friendly solution  that benefits all stakeholders in the agricultural supply chain.
